                <p>Franklin Barbecue is a barbecue restaurant located in Austin, Texas, and has since sold out of brisket every day since its establishment.
                    Their menu consists of pulled pork, pork ribs, sausages, turkey and brisket. For his Texas style brisket, Franklin uses post oak wood and Meyer Angus beef which is seasoned with salt and pepper.
