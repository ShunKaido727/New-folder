                <p>For about a hundred years, from after Reconstruction until the 1990s, the Democratic Party has been the most prominent political party in Texas politics. Since the late 1960s, the Republican Party became the more dominant political pary in Texas. By the 1990s, it became the state's dominant political party and is still today, as Democrats have not won a statewide race since Bob Bullock won the 1994 Lieutenant gubernatorial election.</p>
